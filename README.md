Instead of writing unit test cases manually, developers can now automatically generate them using AI. The workflow is simple and efficient: you write your Dart code in the lib/untested_code.dart file, run the main script in bin/main.dart, and the tool takes care of the rest. It securely reads your Gemini API key from the .env file, sends the source code to the Gemini model, and retrieves relevant test cases. These test cases are then saved into the test/generated_tests/ directory, ready to be executed. The projectâ€™s dependencies are managed through pubspec.yaml, using packages like http for API communication and dotenv for secure environment variable access. This tool is especially useful for developers who want to speed up their testing workflow, maintain consistency, and explore how AI can assist in real-world programming tasks.
